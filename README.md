# CS210-SNHU 

Project 3 from CS210 class at SNHU 

In short our goal of this project was to create a program that used both Python and C++ files and coding in order to output the results of how many each product was bought in a grocery store after reading the information from a file. This program also needed to be able to take in user input of which grocery item they were specifically looking for and output the amount of times that item was bought. The final criteria was to output these items and their frequencies to a file then output the same list of items and a histogram version of their frequencies. 

What did you do particularly well? 

Personally I feel like I did well with creating the output of all the items together and their frequencies by using a dictionary and outputting the keys and values of the dictionary. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

In all honesty, I feel like I could review my functions in python and create some functions in order to deal with looping through the dictionary and adding the items to the dictionary. On top of that I could also work on a function that would loop through and print out the full list of item frequencies so that I can reduce repetitive coding and make the code much easier to read. This would allow the person viewing the code to be able to read and manipulate the program much easier. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

Of all the code in the project and all the syntax that we looked at and problem solved with, I feel like the code I had the most trouble with was a tie between writing the histogram out to the file as well as brainstorming how to record and store the count of each item without duplicating the names. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

Most if not all the skills of this project will easily transfer between course work, projects and general work in the career field. A lot of the processes, syntax and problems that occurred during this will be guaranteed to show up again in future lines of work in this field. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

Adopting general good coding practices such as in line comments describing what is written there and why. Also using as little code as I possibly could in the main program. As for readability I tried my best with keeping a general flow of the files such as in the python file I kept the functions in line of where they would show up in the menu option, on top of this the inline comments help to pinpoint what it is the coder is looking at.
